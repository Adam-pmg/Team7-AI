# Team7-AI
Public repository for Team 7

New technology is now capable of communicating and making content in ways
comparable to humans. Itâ€™s called generative artificial intelligence (AI), and you can use
it to excel in the workforce.
Generative AI can save you time, no matter what field you work in. It can create content
for marketing, forecast numbers for finance, or code for software developers. Publicists
can use it to write press releases. Health professionals can even use it to improve their
diagnosis. You, the worker, are still in charge, you just have more freedom to strategize,
think big, and excel.
Your team has been engaged by one of the largest thinktanks to help propose policy
suggestions to help minimize the potential negative impact on jobs, industry and
personal data.
